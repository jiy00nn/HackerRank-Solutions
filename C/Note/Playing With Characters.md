## Take a **character**, **string** or **sentence** with **character data type**

If you want to input some text data, you can use **character** data type. The charater data type allows **a variable to store only one character**. Because this size of data type is only 1 Byte, it cannot store more data. Storing more text data as a sentence, we need to use character array.

In C language, all strings end in a `\0`<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>. It is called a **string terminator** or **null zero**. The string terminator is added automatically at the end of each string. So if you input a string, you need one more byte. For example, The string "hello", in the picture below, take up **6 bytes**.

Here is the example that how to declare character and character array.
### Example
```C
char c;
char s[];
```

To input text data, you can use `%c` and `%s`. Both expect the same type: `char*`. But the difference is the use of `%c` will read at most one character to it, while use of `%s` will read all non-whitespace characters it finds. The '%s' read until **whitespace characters**. So if you want to read until a newline character, you have to use `%[^\n]`<sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup>.
### Example
```C
scanf("%c", &ch);
scanf("%s%*c", s);
scanf("%[^\n]%*c", sen);
```
> ðŸ’¡ Because of buffer, the statment will read previous line. So prevent to read that, use `%*c`<sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup>.
